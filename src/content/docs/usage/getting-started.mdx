First, make sure to install kubecolor: [Setup / Installation](/setup/install/).

Kubecolor understands every subcommands and options which are available for `kubectl`.
What you have to do is just use `kubecolor` instead of `kubectl` like:

```bash
# instead of this:
kubectl get pods

# use this:
kubecolor get pods
```

If you want to make the colorized kubectl default on your shell,
then override `kubectl` to become an alias instead:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
alias kubectl="kubecolor"
```

Sample:

<SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-get-pods.svg" />

## Forcing colors

Kubecolor will automatically disable its colorization if it detects that its output (stdout)
is not a terminal or is a terminal that does not support colors.
To override this behavior, you can for example use the `--force-colors` flag:

```bash
kubecolor get pods | cat -A
#NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
#nginx-dnmv5   1/1     Running   0          6d6h
#nginx-m8pbc   1/1     Running   0          6d6h
#nginx-qdf9b   1/1     Running   0          6d6h

kubecolor get pods --force-colors | cat -A
#^[[1mNAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE^[[0m$
#^[[37mnginx-dnmv5^[[0m   ^[[36m1/1^[[0m     ^[[32mRunning^[[0m   ^[[36m0^[[0m          ^[[37m6d6h^[[0m$
#^[[37mnginx-m8pbc^[[0m   ^[[36m1/1^[[0m     ^[[32mRunning^[[0m   ^[[36m0^[[0m          ^[[37m6d6h^[[0m$
#^[[37mnginx-qdf9b^[[0m   ^[[36m1/1^[[0m     ^[[32mRunning^[[0m   ^[[36m0^[[0m          ^[[37m6d6h^[[0m$
```

The inverse can also be done by telling kubecolor to not use colors via the `--plain` flag.

## Themes

Theming was introduced in v0.3.0, and has a lot of configs available to provide
fine-grained control over the colorization of the output.

In short, you can for example supply the `--light-background` flag to instead use colors
that are better suited for terminals with light background:

<SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-get-pods-light.svg" />

Alternatively, we also have some colorblind-friendly themes available:

<SvgCommandOutput name="kubectl-get-pods-protanopia.svg" />
