### Docker

Running it via Docker can be nice for just trying out kubecolor:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.kube:/home/nonroot/.kube:ro ghcr.io/kubecolor/kubecolor get pods
```

:::note
If you're getting the error <code>permission denied</code>  (common in environments like WSL):

```log
error: error loading config file "/home/nonroot/.kube/config": open /home/nonroot/.kube/config: permission denied
```

then try changing the permission of your `~/.kube/config` file:

```sh
chmod 644 ~/.kube/config
```

## Usage

kubecolor understands every subcommands and options which are available for `kubectl`. What you have to do is just using `kubecolor`
instead of `kubectl` like:

```sh
kubecolor --context=your_context get pods -o json
```

If you want to make the colorized kubectl default on your shell, just add this line into your shell configuration file:

```sh
alias kubectl="kubecolor"
```
