# Default Usage

kubecolor understands every subcommands and options which are available for `kubectl`. What you have to do is just using `kubecolor`
instead of `kubectl` like:

```sh
kubecolor --context=your_context get pods -o json
```

If you want to make the colorized kubectl default on your shell, just add this line into your shell configuration file:

```sh
alias kubectl="kubecolor"
```

## Supported kubectl version

Because kubecolor internally calls `kubectl` command, if you are using unsupported kubectl version, it's also not supported by kubecolor.
Kubernetes version support policy can be found in [official doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

## kubectl plugins

Even if kubectl supports [plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/) feature, it is not supported by kubecolor, including [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/).
It means you can use plugins from kubecolor (e.g. you can do `kubecolor plugin_name xxx`), but the result won't be colorized.

## Dynamic tty support

When the kubecolor output tty is not standard output, it automatically disables the colorization.
For example, if you are running `kubecolor get pods > result.txt` or `kubecolor get pods | grep xxx`, the output will be passed through to file or another command, so colorization is not applied.
You can force kubecolor do colorization at such cases by passing `--force-colors` flag. See the upcoming section for more details.

## Autocompletion

kubectl provides [autocompletion feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enable-kubectl-autocompletion). If you are
already using it, you might have to configure it for kubecolor.
Please also refer to [kubectl official doc for kubectl autocomplete](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-autocomplete).

## Specify what command to execute as kubectl

Sometimes, you may want to specify which command to use as `kubectl` internally in kubecolor. For example, when you want to use a versioned-kubectl `kubectl.1.19`, you can do that by an environment variable:

```shell
KUBECTL_COMMAND="kubectl.1.19" kubecolor get po
```

When you don't set `KUBECTL_COMMAND`, then `kubectl` is used by default.

## Specify object fresh age threshold

When you want to figure out which object are recently created the fresh ones are colored green. It only works with `get` subcommand.
You can customize threshold level by using environment variable `KUBECOLOR_OBJ_FRESH` with value format [time.Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

```shell
KUBECOLOR_OBJ_FRESH="1m" kubecolor get po
```

Default value is `0s`, it means is disabled.

# Specific shell configuration

## Bash

Add `kubecolor` alias and config in the `~/.bashrc` file:

```shell
alias kubectl=kubecolor
alias k=kubecolor
export KUBECOLOR_OBJ_FRESH=12h # highlight resources newer than 12h
```

For Bash, configuring autocompletion requires adding following line in your shell config file.

```shell
# autocomplete for kubecolor
complete -o default -F __start_kubectl kubecolor
```

If you are using an alias like `k="kubecolor"`, then just change above like:

```shell
complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
```

## Zsh

For zsh make sure these lines are present in your zsh config file:

```shell
# get zsh complete kubectl
source <(kubectl completion zsh)
alias kubectl=kubecolor
# make completion work with kubecolor
compdef kubecolor=kubectl
```

### Oh My ZSH and Powerlevel 10k

Oh My ZSH and the Powerlevel 10k theme brings a lot of features that can be used to ease your life with `kubectl`.

:::note
    If using Oh My ZSH and Powerlevel 10k, do not execute the previous commands. Use the following doc only
:::


- Install Oh My ZSF if needed. This is only a quick install slug:

    ```shell
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```

- Install PowerLevel 10k theme

    ```shell
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    sed 's/^ZSH_THEME=".*"/ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k\/powerlevel10k"/g' -i ~/.zshrc
    zsh
    ```

- Setup your `.zshrc` file

    - Ensure that `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k` is set in your `~/.zshrc` file.
    - add `kubectl` to your plugin list:
        ```shell
        plugins=(brew git python tmux vault terraform kubectl)
        ```

- Setup Dynamic-Prompt in PowerLevel 10k

    Dynamic prompt will auto-diplay the Kubernetes `context` to the right of the status bar (configurable).

    Edit the file `~/.p10k.zsh` (in your user folder) and add `kubecolor` to the line defining `POWERLEVEL9K_KUBECONTEXT_SHOW_ON_COMMAND`. `kubectl` should already be added.
    
    Line should be like:

    ```shell
    typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_KUBECONTEXT_SHOW_ON_COMMAND='kubectl|helm|kubens|kubectx|oc|istioctl|kogito|k9s|helmfile|flux|fluxctl|stern|kubeseal|skaffold|kubecolor'

    ```

- Configure aliasing and completion

    Add to your `~/.zshrc` file:

    ```shell
    alias k=kubecolor
    compdef kubecolor=kubectl # only needed for zsh
    export KUBECOLOR_OBJ_FRESH=12h # highlight resources newer than 12h
    ```


## Fish

Fish completion is officially unsupported by `kubectl`, so it is unsupported by `kubecolor` as well.

However, there are 2 ways we can make them work. Please keep in mind these are a kind of "hack" and not officially supported.

1. Use [evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions](https://github.com/evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions) with `kubecolor`:

   * Install `kubectl` completions (https://github.com/evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions):
      ```
      fisher install evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions
      ```
   * Add the following function to your `config.fish` file:
      ```
      function kubectl
        kubecolor $argv
      end
      ```
2. Use [awinecki/fish-kubecolor-completions](https://github.com/awinecki/fish-kubecolor-completions)

   The first way will override `kubectl` command. If you wish to preserve both `kubectl` and `kubecolor` with completions, you need to copy [evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions](https://github.com/evanlucas/fish-kubectl-completions) for the `kubecolor` command.

   For this purpose, you can use [awinecki/fish-kubecolor-completions](https://github.com/awinecki/fish-kubecolor-completions).
