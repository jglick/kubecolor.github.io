# Default color scheme

As of version v0.3.0, `kubecolor` bundles new themes:

| Preset                  | Description
| ------                  | -----------
| `dark` *(default)*      | For when your terminal's background is dark.
| `light`                 | For when your terminal's background is light/bright.
| `pre-0.0.21-dark`       | Original dark color scheme used before v0.0.21, as well as in the predecessor's ([hidetatz/kubecolor](https://github.com/hidetatz/kubecolor)) version.
| `pre-0.0.21-light`      | Original light color scheme used before v0.0.21, as well as in the predecessor's ([hidetatz/kubecolor](https://github.com/hidetatz/kubecolor)) version.
| `protanopia-dark`       | Color theme for [Protanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/protanopia-red-green-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is dark.
| `protanopia-light`      | Color theme for [Protanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/protanopia-red-green-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is light/bright.
| `deuteranopia-dark`(*)  | Color theme for [Deuteranopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is dark.
| `deuteranopia-light`(*) | Color theme for [Deuteranopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is light/bright.
| `tritanopia-dark`(*)    | Color theme for [Tritanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/tritanopia-blue-yellow-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is dark.
| `tritanopia-light`(*)   | Color theme for [Tritanopia color blindness](https://www.color-blindness.com/tritanopia-blue-yellow-color-blindness/). For when your terminal's background is light/bright.

Kubecolor uses the `dark` theme by default.

# Switching to a different color theme

There's two way to switch to a different color theme:

- setting the variable `KUBECOLOR_PRESET` to a specific theme. Ex:
  ```shell
  `KUBECOLOR_PRESET="protanopia-dark"`
  ```
- configuring the default theme in the configuration file at `~/.kube/color.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  preset: deuteranopia-light
  ```

## Light Theme

you can switch to the light theme by either:

- setting the variable `KUBECOLOR_LIGHT_BACKGROUND=true`
- setting the `--light-background` argument on the command line
- setting the variable `KUBECOLOR_PRESET="light"`
- configuring the config file ( `~/.kube/color.yaml`) with `preset: light`

## Custom color theme

It is also possible to build your own color Theme, either by setting some variables or building up a config file.

### Picking a new `color`

The `color` type supports a variety of formats. In its simplest form,
you specify one of:

* Named colors, which are mapped to the [3-bit and 4-bit ANSI colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit):

  black, red, green, brown, yellow, blue, magenta, purple, cyan, white, hiblack,
  lightblack, darkgray, gray, darkgrey, grey, hired, lightred, higreen,
  lightgreen, lime, hibrown, lightbrown, hiyellow, lightyellow, gold, hiblue,
  lightblue, himagenta, lightmagenta, hipurple, lightpurple, hicyan, lightcyan,
  hiwhite, lightwhite

  These colors depend on your terminal's color settings. So if your terminal
  is configured with "Solarized Dark" theme, then the `red` color name will be
  the "Solarized Dark red".

* A single [256-color number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit):

  * `5` (magenta)
  * `82` (a light lime color)
  * `240` (dark gray)

* Hexadecimal: (case insensitive)

  * `#aaff00`
  * `aaff00`
  * `0xaaff00`
  * `#af0`
  * `af0`

* RGB, with values ranging from 0 to 255, in two different syntaxes:

  * `192, 255, 238`
  * `rgb(192, 255, 238)`

* Raw escape data, in case you know what escape code you're looking for.

  * `raw(53)` (overlined)
  * `raw(4;53)` (underlined & overlined)

By default the value refers to the foreground color (text color).
The full syntax would be `fg=red`
But you can also set the background color by adding in `bg=`, such as `bg=blue`.

To set both foreground and background, you join together the colors with
a colon `:`, like so: `fg=red:bg=blue`

In addition, you can also apply style modifiers:

* `bold`, or `b`: Bold text styling, **such as this**
* `fuzzy`: Faint text style (inverse of bold)
* `italic`, `i`: Italic text, *such as this*
* `underline`, or `u`: Underlined text, <ins>such as this</ins>
* `blink`: Blinking text. Not widely supported by terminals.
* `fastblink`: Rapid blinking text. Not widely supported by terminals.
* `reverse`, `invert`: Swaps foreground and background colors
* `concealed`, `hidden`, `invisible`: Hidden text. Not widely supported.
* `strikethrough`: Crossed out text, <del>such as this</del>

Here are some examples of settings colors as environment variables:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_DATA_NULL="gray:italic"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg=white:bold:underline"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STDERR_ERROR="fg=yellow:bg=red:bold"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STDERR_ERROR="#c0ffee"
```

#### Managing a list of `color[]`

Similar to the `color` type, some fields allows multiple separate colors to be applied.
This is commonly used to allow alternating colors on columns.

The colors are separated by a slash `/`.

Example:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_COLUMNS="red/green/blue"
```

Above represents a `color[]` value of 3 colors, where your columns'
color would cycle those colors: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, etc.

You can of course use any color syntax, to for example have it cycle on
background color with some style modifiers instead:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_COLUMNS="bg=red:underline/bg=green:italic/bg=blue:bold"
```

### Using Theme variables

### Creating a Theme using the configuration file

The benefit of creating a configuration file is that it can be shared with co-workers or
used on different computers.

Edit your config file and set any of the values in your theme. If not set, 
the value from the default theme, set in the `preset` field, is used:

```yaml
preset: dark
theme:

    info: white # (color) general color for when things are informational
    primary: magenta # (color) general color for when things are focus
    secondary: cyan # (color) general color for when things are secondary focus
    success: green # (color) general color for when things are good
    warning: yellow # (color) general color for when things are wrong
    danger: red # (color) general color for when things are bad
    muted: gray:italic # (color) general color for when things are less relevant
    key: hicyan / cyan # (color[]) general color for keys (fallback to [theme.base.secondary])
