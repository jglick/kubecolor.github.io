The `color` type supports a variety of formats.
Here are some examples of settings colors as environment variables:

```bash
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_DATA_NULL="gray:italic"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg=white:bold:underline"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STDERR_ERROR="fg=yellow:bg=red:bold"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_STDERR_ERROR="#c0ffee"
```

In its simplest form, you specify one of:

* Named colors, which are mapped to the [3-bit and 4-bit ANSI colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit):

  black, red, green, brown, yellow, blue, magenta, purple, cyan, white, hiblack,
  lightblack, darkgray, gray, darkgrey, grey, hired, lightred, higreen,
  lightgreen, lime, hibrown, lightbrown, hiyellow, lightyellow, gold, hiblue,
  lightblue, himagenta, lightmagenta, hipurple, lightpurple, hicyan, lightcyan,
  hiwhite, lightwhite

  These colors depend on your terminal's color settings. So if your terminal
  is configured with ["Dracula"](https://draculatheme.com/) theme,
  then the `red` color name will be the "Dracula" variant of red.

* A single [256-color number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit):

  * `5` (magenta)
  * `82` (a light lime color)
  * `240` (dark gray)

* Hexadecimal: (case insensitive)

  * `#aaff00`
  * `aaff00`
  * `0xaaff00`
  * `#af0`
  * `af0`

* RGB, with values ranging from 0 to 255, in two different syntaxes:

  * `192, 255, 238`
  * `rgb(192, 255, 238)`

* Raw escape data, in case you know what escape code you're looking for.

  * `raw(53)` (overlined)
  * `raw(4;53)` (underlined & overlined)

By default the value refers to the foreground color (text color).
The full syntax would be `fg=red`
But you can also set the background color by adding in `bg=`, such as `bg=blue`.

To set both foreground and background, you join together the colors with
a colon `:`, like so: `fg=red:bg=blue`

In addition, you can also apply style modifiers:

* `bold`, or `b`: Bold text styling, **such as this**
* `fuzzy`: Faint text style (inverse of bold)
* `italic`, `i`: Italic text, *such as this*
* `underline`, or `u`: Underlined text, <ins>such as this</ins>
* `blink`: Blinking text. Not widely supported by terminals.
* `fastblink`: Rapid blinking text. Not widely supported by terminals.
* `reverse`, `invert`: Swaps foreground and background colors
* `concealed`, `hidden`, `invisible`: Hidden text. Not widely supported.
* `strikethrough`: Crossed out text, <del>such as this</del>

Lastly, whitespace is allowed in the color codes:

```bash
# These are all semantically identical
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg=white:bold:underline"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg=white : bold : underline"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="fg = white : bold : underline"
export KUBECOLOR_THEME_TABLE_HEADER="  fg   =   white   :   bold   :   underline  "
```
