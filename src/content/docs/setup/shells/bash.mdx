description: Setting up kubecolor for the Bash shell

Add `kubecolor` alias and config in the `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
alias kubectl=kubecolor
```

## Completions

In Bash, the above `alias` setting does not distrupt completions on `kubectl`, even though it's remapped to execute `kubecolor`.

However, if you want completion when explicitly running `kubecolor` then you need to add the following:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

# Make "kubecolor" borrow the same completion logic as "kubectl"
complete -o default -F __start_kubectl kubecolor
```

If you are using an alias like `k=kubectl`, then you also need to add completion for `k`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
alias k=kubectl
complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
```

As a prerequisite, you need `kubectl` completions installed.
This can be achieved by either of these steps:

- If your `kubectl` installation already came shipped with bash completions
  (when you did `apt install kubectl`, `dnf install kubectl`, etc).
  Try out `kubectl` to see if the completions are already installed before you install it twice.

- or you add this to `~/.bashrc`:

  ```bash
  # ~/.bashrc

  # This needs to be added before "complete -o default -F __start_kubectl ..."
  source <(kubectl completion bash)
  ```
