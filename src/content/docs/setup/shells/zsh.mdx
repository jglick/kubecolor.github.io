description: Setting up kubecolor for the Zsh shell
---

For zsh make sure these lines are present in your zsh config file (e.g `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`):

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
alias kubectl=kubecolor
```

## Completions

Completion can be easily borrowed from the `kubectl` command by adding this to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc

# Make "kubecolor" borrow the same completion logic as "kubectl"
compdef kubecolor=kubectl
```

As a prerequisite, you need `kubectl` completions installed.
This can be achieved by either of these steps:

- If your `kubectl` installation already came shipped with zsh completions
  (when you did `apt install kubectl`, `dnf install kubectl`, etc).
  Try out `kubectl` to see if the completions are already installed before you install it twice.

- or you add this to `~/.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  # ~/.zshrc

  # This needs to be added before "compdef kubecolor=kubectl"
  source <(kubectl completion zsh)
  ```

- or you can executed this:

  ```bash
  kubectl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kubectl"
  ```
